# Related-movies-
This is the final course project for a Python course.
The simple application takes a list of movies as input. 
For each of the movies, a related movie list is produced using the Taste Dive API
Then for each of the related movies produced, some information is generated about the movie using the OMDB API.
Based on the Rotten Tomatoes rating, the related movies list is sorted in descending order with the movie with the highest rating appearing first
in the list followed by the other movies.
If two movies have the same Rotten Tomatoes rating, the tie is broken by using the reverse alphabetical order such that, 
if for example, Deadpool and Friday have the same Rotten Tomatoes rating, Rotten Tomatoes will appear first in the list 
before Deadpool
